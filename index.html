            <h2>Navigating this Visualisation</h2>
            <p>
              - At the top we have the World Map which displays the overall global sparsity of countries' life expectancies. We can already see that countries
              and regions tend to have similar life expectancies as countries around them.
            </p>
            <p>
              - In the following sections we will be comparing various factors and it's possibility of correlation with life expectancy using Bubble Charts.
              We will look in depth regarding findings and what it means for those factors effects on life expectancy of the country.
            </p>
            <p>
              - Lastly, we wil use our analysis from the next section to create comparisons between varying factors the contribute life expectancy between entire 
              continents.

            <h2>Birth Rate and GDP per Capita influence on Life Expectancy</h2>
            <p>
              - As we see here with these two Bubble charts, the first plot shows a strong negative correlation between life expectancy and birth rate. And the
              second plot shows a strong positive correltion between life expectancy and GDP per capita (disclaimer the GDP per capita is on a log scale).
            </p>
            <p>
              - Regarding the strong negative correlation between birth rate and life expectancy, that correlation doesn't mean causation, which may be true 
              in this case.
            </p>
            <p>
              - It is obvious that countries with high GDP per capita tend to have longer living citizens, as they are able have a higher living standard.

            <h2>Unemployment Rate and Out of pocket health expenditure influence on Life Expectancy</h2>
            <p>
              - Shown here are the bubble charts comparing life expectancy and unemployment rate and out of pocker health expenditure. There seems
              to be no sort of correlation between life expectancy and unemployment rate, however, there is a weak negative correlation between
              out of pocket health expenditure and life expectancy.
            </p>
            <p>
              - It is interesting that there is no correlation between unemloyment rate and life expectancy, as, more employed people would relate
              to the increase of GDP per capita which as we have seen has a strong correlation with life expectancy.

            <h2>Continent Analysis</h2>
            <p>
             - Something interesting to consider in this data is that in all of the bubble charts when we filter the continents, they seemed 
             grouped up compared to the rest of the data.
            </p>
            <p>
              -  Implying that countries in certain locations have similar life expectancies compared to those around them.
             </p>
            <p>
              - Hence, we will look more into this claim and see whether there is a correlation between continents and life expectancy through new
              socio-economic factors.

            <p>
             -  Here we have a donut chart and 4 grouped bar charts each displaying various factors regarding GDP, life expectancy, infant
              mortality, gross primary education enrollment (%), and fertility rate.
            </p>
            <p>
              -  We can see that there is some correlation between these factors, especially with life expectancy, infant mortality, and fertility
              rate. However, not so much with GDP and gross primary education enrollment (%).
             </p>
             <p>
              -  There is a negative relationship between life expectancy and infant mortality and fertility rate, which makes sense when we look
              at the relationship between birth rate and life expectancy.
